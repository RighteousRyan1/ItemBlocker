Item Blocker is a simple mod that allows you to block what items enter your inventory during play!

Assign 2 hotkeys:
- Add
- Remove

In your inventory, press either of these keys to add or remove an item from a list of items you don't want entering your inventory!

There is a config for the mod where you can remove and add items even if they aren't in your inventory.
